# SurgNet
This is the repository of the following work:
Jiachen Chen, Mengyang Li, Hu Han, Zhiming Zhao, and Xilin Chen. “SurgNet: Self-supervised Pretraining with Semantic Consistency for Vessel and Instrument Segmentation in Surgical Images”, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, 2023 (Accepted).

## 1. Release of the inference code and the pretrained models: 
The authors are cleaning up the inference code, i.e., decoupling the inferencing code with the training code, checking the parameters related to the inference code, and verifying the correctness of individual pretrained models. Subsequently, the authors will upload the inference code and pre-trained models to this repository. Instructions for installing the packages necessary for running the inference code will also be provided here.
   
## 2. Application of the IVIS Intraoperative Vessel and Instrument Segmentation (IVIS) dataset: 
Individuals interested in accessing the IVIS dataset are required to consult the End User License Agreement [EULA](https://github.com/HanHuCAS/SurgNet/raw/main/IVIS%20Database%20EULA(1.1).docx) and submit an application. Upon approval of the completed and signed EULA by our Institutional Review Board (IRB), the applicant will receive a download link to the dataset.
