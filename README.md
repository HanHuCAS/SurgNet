# SurgNet
This is the repository of the following work:
Jiachen Chen, Mengyang Li, Hu Han, Zhiming Zhao, and Xilin Chen. “SurgNet: Self-supervised Pretraining with Semantic Consistency for Vessel and Instrument Segmentation in Surgical Images”, IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, Under review.

## 1. Release of the inference code and the pretrained models: 
The authors are cleaning up the inference code, i.e., decoupling the inferencing code with the training code, checking the parameters related to inference code, and verifying the correctness of individual pretrained models. Then, the authors will put the inference code and pretrained models into this repository.
   
## 2. Application of the IVIS Intraoperative Vessel and Instrument Segmentation (IVIS) dataset: 
Please refer to the End User License Agreement (EULA) [link] and submit the IVIS dataset application.
